# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

Initial idea.

The objective is create a Dapp in Etherereum to do non-profit social projects.

There will be two types of participants.

One of them will be those that propose projects that have a social impact, for example, in your neighborhood.
To create a project, they must deposit an amount in ETH through a wallet such as Metamask, and they will target an amount to be raised.

After a time limit the smart contract, if the required funds have not been obtained, the funds will be returned to the sponsors (the initially deposited ETH will be used for transactions). If the recommended amount has been reached then the initial funds will be returned.

On the other hand, there are the sponsors who can lean towards a project, no matter if the limit is exceeded, they can make contributions. There will also be a minimum quantity.

Another possibility that sponsors will have is to vote for a project (this will require a transaction) and they can override that vote at any time.
